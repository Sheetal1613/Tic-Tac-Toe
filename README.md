# Tic-Tac-Toe
A feature-rich and interactive Tic Tac Toe web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to demonstrate strong fundamentals of front-end development and game logic implementation.
The project goes beyond the traditional version by adding modern UI features, AI gameplay, and customization options.

Unlike a basic Tic Tac Toe game, this project focuses on user experience, customization, and intelligent gameplay. It integrates modern UI elements such as dark mode, sound controls, and theme switching, while also offering both multiplayer (Player vs Player) and AI-based (Player vs Computer) gameplay modes.

The AI opponent supports multiple difficulty levels, allowing users to either play casually or challenge a smarter computer strategy. Additionally, the game supports custom player names via a modal-based input system, making the interaction more engaging and personalized.
